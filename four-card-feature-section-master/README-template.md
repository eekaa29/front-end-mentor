### What I learned

I have used grid for the first time, It has been useful to see how many things I could do if I learnt it. Furthermore, I am learning more deeply how to work with flexbox, wich I think that is a must if I want to create great projects.

### Continued development

I feel that working on this project I have improved a lot.Now, I'm able to figure out the place of each element more fluidly, which is something that few days ago I wasn't able to. I see the progress. I will keep showing up.
