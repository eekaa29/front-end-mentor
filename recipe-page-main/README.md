### What I learned

As this projects layout have been more difficult to get done than previous ones, I have practise how to get a more complex layout, with more content and elements to be aware of. In gerenal It has been a challenge, which has been so useful for me to improve. Moreover I have practice other interesting things such as transitions, lists...

### Continued development

I am focusing my efforts on becoming better at HTML and Css usage, once I feel comfortable enought, I will start including JavaScript in future projects.
